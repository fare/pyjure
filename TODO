Random TODO items for this skylark implementation in Clojure
* write down some examples of generated code
   have a collection of simple functions that span
   the entire base language and its various interactions,
   and write down what the generated code would look like.

   def fib(n):
     if n == 0: return 0
     elif n == 1: return 1
     else: return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

   (defn fib$internal [n]
     (if (= n 0) ;; we know it's a boolean, so no $truthy required
         0 ;; return directly,
         ;; continuation not bound to a function,
         ;; because it's only called in one branch.
         (if (= n 1) 1
             (+ (fib$internal (- n 1)) (fib$internal (- n 2))))))
         ;; we can call internal function because it is known
   (def fib (one-arg-function fib$internal))


* enumerate effects that can be done by a block of code,
  that have to be accounted by some monad at runtime,
  and some state in the compile-time analysis.

  refer to variable [name, projection (e.g. as boolean; error if not list; etc.)]
  bind variable [name, type]
  return [type]
  yield [type]
  raise an exception [type]
     including implicit type mismatch!
  non-termination []
  re-bind an outside variable [variable] ;; FORBIDDEN
  side-effect the object bound to a variable [variable] ;; FORBIDDEN

  If none of these effects happens, the block can be moved
  earlier or later if used, and skipped altogether if not.


  at analysis-time, each effect is annotated with some domain
  (i.e. notional set of input conditions) over which the effect happens.
  :⊥ (don't know anything about this effect yet)
  false (effect never happens when this block is run)
  true (effect always happen if this block is run)
  :⊤ (effect may or may not happen if this block is run)

  Future versions can use more elaborate flow analyzes,
  but for now we want the minimum that can produce code that runs.

   pass bindings and binding-witnesses
   (or, use an unbound marker distinct from None?)
   lexical return
   skynode definitions as side-effect
   dynamic calling convention
   global state (NO!)
   [Compile time]
   analysis state(s)

* we need the effects for the current snippet and its block continuation.

* soup up analysis phase


* figure out how exceptions interact with shadowing of local bindings.
   In Python, x = v is a variable assignment side-effect, so
   the handler and continuation see the modified variables.
   In Skylark, x = v is the shadowing of a binding, so
   the handler and continuation see the original bindings.

for target in gen:
   if ~foo: continue
   elif ~bar: break
   else a=f(a,target)
return a


  g# = gen
  while(seq(g#)):
    (target,g#) = decons(g#)
    if ~foo: c=c+e ; continue
    elif ~bar: b=c; break
    elif ~baz: return a
    elif ~quux: a=f(a,target)
    a = g(a)

  (let [[return? a b c]
   (loop [g# g#
          a  a
          b  b
          c  c]
   ;; e is refered but never modified, so needn't be returned
   ;; if any of a, b, c wasn't needed later,
   ;; it wouldn't be needed as a return function either.
    (if (seq g#)
       (let [d# (decons g#)
             target (first d#)
             g# (second d#)]
          (if ~foo (let [c ($add c e)] (recur g# a b c))
              (if ~bar (let [b c] [nil a b c])
                  (if ~baz [true a nil nil]
                      (let [a (f a target)]
                           (recur g# a b c))))))))]
   ;; because return is an option, call it
   ;; if it were either always return or never return, we wouldn't
   ;; need the conditional
   (if return? a ;; optimization: because a is the next position
       CONTINUATION))

* to preserve tail-position in for/while loops,
  we can't have tail-called into a continuation function.
  instead, we have to use some monadic transform to simulate return
  (or we could use an exception... yikes, no).

* Annotate each function with its stack implicit monadic transform,
  know how to automatically call functions *lower* in the stack,
  error out if calling higher.
  Also available at runtime?
  Or make it always top of stack at runtime?
  Of course, generators have one more level than other functions...

* Yield can be implemented through a delimcc monad:
   http://okmij.org/ftp/continuations/implementations.html

* Is this a bug in core.match?
   (match [[1 2 3 4]] [[(or 0 1 2) :as x & more]] [x more])
   ==> CompilerException java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to resolve
   symbol: x in this context, compiling:(null:1:1)
   workaround:
   (match [[1 2 3 4]] [[x :guard #{0 1 2} & more]] [x more])
